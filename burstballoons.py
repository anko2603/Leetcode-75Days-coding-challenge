# There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
# Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
# Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
# Example 1:
# Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
# Output: 2

    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        arrows = 1

            if start > prev_end:
                arrows += 1
